Aloe vera, scientifically classified as Aloe barbadensis miller, is a distinctive succulent recognizable by its rosette growth habit featuring thick, fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are grey-green to bright green in color, often speckled with white spots during the juvenile stage, and lined with small, non-sharp serrated teeth or marginal spikes along the edges. To maintain this vibrant appearance, the plant requires approximately six to eight hours of bright, indirect sunlight daily, as placing it in direct, scorching mid-day sun can cause the foliage to suffer from sun stress, turning the leaves brown, reddish, or bronze, while conversely, insufficient lighting results in etiolation, where the plant becomes leggy, stretched, and weak as it reaches for a light source. The structural integrity of the plant depends heavily on a well-draining soil environment, best achieved using a gritty cactus or succulent potting mix amended with perlite, pumice, or coarse sand to ensure rapid drainage, housed ideally in an unglazed terracotta or clay pot which allows soil moisture to evaporate through the porous walls, preventing the water retention that leads to root rot. Watering must strictly follow the "soak and dry" method, where the soil is drenched thoroughly until water flows from the drainage holes and then allowed to dry out completely before the next irrigation, with the frequency significantly reduced during the winter dormancy months; signs of overwatering include soft, mushy, translucent, or yellowing leaves that may rot at the base, whereas underwatering presents as wrinkled, puckered, curling, or thinning leaves that lack their usual turgidity. Environmentally, Aloe vera thrives in temperatures between 55°F and 80°F (13°C to 27°C) and prefers low to average household humidity, but it is not frost-tolerant and must be protected from freezing temperatures or drafts below 50°F. Propagation is most effectively performed through division by removing "pups" or offsets—miniature plants that sprout from the base of the mother plant—which can be gently separated and repotted once they develop their own root systems, as propagation via leaf cuttings is difficult and prone to rot. Regarding safety, while the inner gel is used medicinally, the plant’s skin and the yellow latex layer contain anthraquinones and saponins, making it toxic to cats, dogs, and humans if ingested, often resulting in symptoms such as vomiting, lethargy, diarrhea, and abdominal irritation.
