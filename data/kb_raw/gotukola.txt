Gotu kola (Centella asiatica), also called Indian pennywort or brahmi in some traditions, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial groundcover with a creeping, stolon-forming growth habit, easily identified by its small, round to kidney-shaped leaves borne singly on long, slender petioles arising from nodes along the runners; each leaf is usually 2–4 cm across, with a shallow notch where the petiole attaches, finely scalloped or crenate margins, and a glossy to satin surface that appears bright to medium green when well nourished and slightly yellowish or pale when stressed by nutrient deficiency or excess sun, while the thin, soft texture and delicate veins make it look more like a leafy herb than a succulent. The plant hugs the ground, forming dense mats as its creeping stems root at the nodes, and in moist, rich conditions it spreads vigorously, sending out new rosettes that quickly fill the surface of a pot, garden bed edge, pond margin, or aquaponic bed; in water or very wet soil, runners may float or sit at the surface, with leaves resting on or just above the water, whereas in drier locations it produces more numerous but smaller leaves and shorter internodes, which growers can use as a visual clue for water and fertility levels. Gotu kola prefers bright, indirect light to partial shade and often thrives where it receives about 4–6 hours of filtered or soft sunlight per day, such as morning sun plus afternoon shade or dappled light under taller plants; in cooler or mild climates it can tolerate and even enjoy more direct sun if water is abundant, but in hot climates harsh midday or afternoon sun can cause leaf scorch, manifesting as bleached, yellow-brown patches, crisping at the edges, or a generally burnt appearance, which indicates the plant needs more shade or increased humidity and soil moisture. When grown in too little light, such as deep indoor corners, the petioles elongate excessively, resulting in long, weak stems with leaves spaced far apart, the foliage becomes paler, and the mat is loose rather than dense, a “leggy gotu kola” symptom that signals the need for a brighter window, such as a south- or east-facing exposure with filtered light, or supplemental grow lighting placed to provide high but indirect intensity. Unlike many drought-tolerant herbs, gotu kola is a moisture-loving plant that naturally grows in damp, marshy soils, along stream banks, and at pond edges; it thrives in consistently moist to even boggy conditions as long as water is not completely stagnant and there is some oxygen available to the roots, so in containers the goal is to keep the soil evenly moist, not allowing it to dry out fully, yet still ensuring drainage to prevent anaerobic root rot. A practical watering method is deep, regular watering so the entire root zone is moistened, followed by only a slight drying at the surface before watering again, effectively maintaining a constant, damp (but not soupy) profile; in warm weather this may require watering every 1–3 days in pots, especially in porous containers or windy, sunny positions, whereas in cooler seasons or indoors frequency may drop to every few days or once a week, always guided by checking that the upper layer feels moist but not saturated and never bone dry. Gotu kola does not tolerate prolonged drought: if the soil dries out, the plant quickly wilts, leaves flop and feel limp, the edges may crisp, and in severe cases foliage dies back, though the roots can sometimes resprout if rehydrated before they are completely killed, making wilting a clear early warning for underwatering that should be corrected with thorough soaking and adjustment of frequency. At the same time, soil that is waterlogged with no drainage can lead to root problems and brown spotting; growers report that leaves may show brown spots or rotting if the soil remains saturated in an airless medium, so even though gotu kola loves moisture, the potting mix must still allow some air, and in pots there should always be drainage holes to avoid stagnant water. For soil and pot choice, gotu kola performs best in rich, loamy, organic soil that holds moisture yet drains sufficiently, often described as moist, fertile, and slightly acidic to neutral with a pH around 6.0–7.0; mixing quality potting soil or garden loam with compost and a bit of coarse material like sand, fine bark, or perlite can create the balance of water retention and drainage needed for lush growth, and in pond margins or aquaponic setups, a heavier loam or clay-rich substrate can be used submerged or semi-submerged as long as water quality and oxygenation are maintained. Containers should have drainage holes so that excess water can escape, especially for indoor or patio culture, and standard plastic, glazed ceramic, or terracotta pots all work, though plastic and glazed pots retain moisture longer (useful in hot, dry climates), whereas unglazed terracotta dries faster and may require more frequent watering; shallow, wide containers or trays suit its creeping habit and allow the stems to root and spread horizontally to form a dense edible mat. Environmentally, gotu kola prefers warm, humid conditions similar to its native tropical and subtropical habitats, growing best at moderate temperatures commonly cited around 20–30 °C, with many indoor guides suggesting an ideal range of roughly 18–27 °C and emphasizing protection from frost; it can tolerate mild cool periods but generally stops growing or suffers damage when exposed to freezing temperatures, so in temperate climates, pots should be brought indoors or into greenhouses before frost and kept above about 10 °C for continued growth. High humidity, often around 60–70%, supports vigorous growth and reduces leaf-edge browning, so gotu kola is very suitable for greenhouses, pond edges, or humid indoor rooms; in dry indoor air, it may need more frequent watering, and grouping plants or using humidity trays can help, though misting should not be excessive if it leads to fungal issues. Propagation of gotu kola is straightforward due to its creeping, node-rooting habit: clumps can be divided by cutting or pulling apart sections of the mat, each with several leaves and rooted nodes, then replanting them in moist, fertile soil where they quickly establish; stem pieces with nodes can also be treated like cuttings, laid on or slightly buried in damp substrate so that the nodes root, effectively multiplying the plant vegetatively with high success. Gotu kola also propagates readily from seeds, which should be sown on or just beneath the surface of moist, lightweight, well-draining potting mix, kept evenly moist and warm until germination, making seed a viable option for starting new genetic lines, while division and cuttings are ideal for quickly expanding an existing line with identical medicinal and flavor characteristics. In terms of toxicity and safety, gotu kola is widely used as a medicinal and culinary herb in Asia and beyond, and numerous pharmacological and toxicological studies have been conducted on Centella asiatica extracts; acute and sub-chronic toxicity studies in animals indicate relatively low toxicity at typical therapeutic doses, though some research suggests that very high or prolonged doses of certain extracts can induce liver changes in experimental models, highlighting the importance of respecting dosage and duration in medicinal use rather than assuming unlimited safety. For humans, fresh leaves consumed in traditional food or teas are generally considered safe for healthy adults in moderate amounts, but high-dose supplements or concentrated extracts may interact with medications, affect the liver in susceptible individuals, or cause skin sensitivity, so people with liver disease, pregnancy, or on chronic medication should seek medical guidance before taking strong preparations. For pets such as cats and dogs, gotu kola is not commonly listed among highly toxic ornamental plants, and small incidental ingestions are unlikely to cause severe poisoning, yet non-food plant ingestion can still lead to mild gastrointestinal upset like vomiting or diarrhea, and theoretically, chronic high-dose exposure to medicinal extracts could affect the liver similarly to human concerns, so it is prudent to prevent pets from eating large quantities and to consult a veterinarian if unusual or persistent symptoms occur
