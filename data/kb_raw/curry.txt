Curry leaf plant (Murraya/ Bergera koenigii) is an aromatic, evergreen to semi-deciduous shrub or small tree with a naturally bushy, multi-branched growth habit, typically reaching 1–3 m in containers and taller in the ground, and is easily recognized by its pinnate leaves arranged alternately along slender stems, each leaf composed of many small, narrow, oval to lance-shaped leaflets with smooth, slightly wavy margins and a pointed tip; the leaflets are deep green when healthy, lighter or yellowish when nutrient-deficient or light-stressed, and release a strong, characteristic curry aroma when crushed, with a texture that is thin yet slightly leathery and not succulent. Young shoots often appear soft, tender, and bright green, gradually darkening and woody with age, and the plant tends to produce flushes of new growth in warm seasons, forming a rounded canopy if regularly pinched or pruned; without pruning, it can become tall and sparse, with bare lower stems and foliage concentrated at the top, which many growers correct by heading back the main stems to encourage branching. For optimal growth, curry leaf plants prefer full sun to bright light, typically needing at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily to produce dense, lush foliage with intense flavor, although they can tolerate 4–6 hours of direct light or very bright indirect light with somewhat slower growth; plants grown in insufficient light become leggy, with long, weak stems bearing widely spaced leaves, pale yellowish foliage, and reduced aroma intensity, clearly indicating a need for a brighter position or supplemental light indoors. In very intense summer sun, especially in hot, dry climates or on reflective balconies, the foliage may show signs of too much light and heat stress such as leaf scorch, brown or crisp tips and edges, or small pale, sunburned patches, so potted plants benefit from light afternoon shade or filtered sun to avoid leaf burn while still meeting their high light requirement. Watering curry leaf correctly involves maintaining consistent, moderate moisture without waterlogging; the plant prefers a pattern where the top 2–5 cm of soil are allowed to dry slightly between waterings but the root zone never stays soggy, so a practical method is to water thoroughly until excess drains from the holes, then wait until the upper soil feels dry to the touch before watering again, adjusting frequency based on temperature and pot size. In warm, active growing seasons (spring and summer) with full sun, this may translate to watering every few days to once a week, depending on climate and container, while in cooler or low-light winter conditions the plant’s growth slows and water needs drop sharply, so watering should be cut back to only when the top layer is clearly dry, sometimes every 2–3 weeks, with many experienced growers watering very infrequently from December to late winter to prevent root rot. Overwatering and poor drainage are major threats, causing roots to sit in saturated soil and leading to root rot, which presents as limp, drooping stems, yellowing or blackening leaves that may fall prematurely, mushy roots, and a sour smell from the pot; underwatering for extended periods, on the other hand, leaves the plant dry and stressed, with curling, dry, crispy, or shriveled leaflets and an overall wilted, sparse look, though mildly dehydrated plants usually respond well once a regular, deep-but-not-frequent watering routine is re-established. For soil, curry leaf plants prefer a fertile, well-draining, slightly acidic mix rich in organic matter; a good potting blend can be made from loamy garden soil combined with compost or well-rotted manure and coarse material like sand, perlite, or vermiculite to enhance drainage and aeration, often aiming for a pH range around 5.5–6.5 so nutrients remain available and roots remain healthy. The soil should feel loose and crumbly rather than heavy or sticky; compacted clay or purely peat-based mixes that hold water for a long time increase the risk of waterlogging and should be improved with coarse aggregates and organic material before planting. Because curry leaf plants dislike “wet feet,” the pot must have generous drainage holes, and unglazed terracotta or clay containers are often recommended since their porous walls allow excess moisture to evaporate, improving oxygen around the roots and reducing the chance of root diseases; plastic or glazed pots can also be used if drainage is excellent, but they retain moisture longer, so watering needs to be more conservative to avoid saturation. Environmental conditions should mimic the plant’s tropical to subtropical origin: curry leaf plants thrive in warm temperatures, with many sources recommending keeping them above about 18 °C (65 °F) for robust growth, ideally in the 21–29 °C range, and noting that growth slows or stops and foliage may drop when temperatures fall too low. Exposure to temperatures below about 4–5 °C (around 40 °F) is not conducive to growth and can damage the plant, which is frost-tender and should be protected from freezing by moving pots indoors or to a sheltered area before cold snaps; in winter, partial defoliation or drying of leaves can occur as the plant goes semi-dormant, but new shoots usually emerge again in spring if the roots remain healthy and conditions warm up. Curry leaf plants prefer moderate to high humidity and respond well to environments that are not extremely dry; in very dry indoor air, especially with heating or air conditioning, tips may brown and leaves may drop more easily, so occasional misting around (not soaking) the foliage, grouping plants, or using a humidity tray can help maintain a slightly more humid microclimate. Propagation is commonly done both by seeds and vegetative methods; seeds from ripe curry berries can be sown fresh in warm, moist, well-draining media, though germination can be slow and variable, while semi-hardwood stem cuttings taken from healthy branches can root in a light, airy medium when kept warm and slightly moist, though success rates fluctuate depending on timing, hormone use, and environmental control. As the plant matures, it often produces multiple stems from the base and can be divided by carefully separating rooted sections when repotting, ensuring each division has adequate roots and some top growth before potting into fresh, well-draining soil; over several years, judicious pruning and occasional cutting back of the main stems stimulates bushier growth and provides abundant leafy stems that can be harvested for culinary use while keeping the plant compact and productive. Regarding toxicity, curry leaf plant is widely consumed as a culinary herb in South Asian cuisine, and the leaves are generally considered safe and edible for humans when used in normal food quantities, with multiple pharmacological studies exploring their antioxidant and medicinal properties and acute toxicity tests in animals suggesting relatively low toxicity at typical consumption levels. However, as with any herb, very large doses or concentrated extracts can have physiological effects, and people with specific medical conditions, allergies, or those taking certain medications should consult healthcare professionals before using medicinal doses; pets such as cats and dogs are not commonly reported as being seriously poisoned by occasional ingestion of curry leaves, but non-food plant material can still cause mild gastrointestinal upset such as vomiting or diarrhea in sensitive animals, so it is prudent to prevent pets from chewing large amounts and to seek veterinary advice if persistent symptoms occur
