Lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus), also called lemon grass or oil grass, is a clump-forming, perennial grass with a dense, fountain-like growth pattern, producing tight tussocks of long, narrow, strap-shaped leaves that can reach 60–120 cm in height and about 2–3 cm in width, arching outward from a basal crown of thickened, pale green to white stems that resemble scallions or spring onions when trimmed and peeled, which is the main culinary part. The leaves are typically medium to blue-green when well-nourished, often with a faint glaucous sheen, and feel coarse and slightly sharp along the edges due to fine silica; when crushed, they emit a strong lemon-citrus aroma, a key identification feature that distinguishes lemongrass from other ornamental grasses. Over time, the plant expands by producing new shoots from the base, forming a broad, dome-shaped clump with layered foliage, and in ideal conditions it can spread 60–90 cm across or more, requiring division or a larger pot to prevent root binding. Lemongrass thrives in full sun and generally needs at least 6–8 hours of direct sunlight daily for vigorous growth, strong flavor, and sturdy, upright leaves, making it well suited to open garden beds, sunny terraces, or bright balconies; while it tolerates light partial shade, especially in very hot regions, insufficient light often leads to weaker, more lax growth, paler leaves, and a thinner clump, which are classic “leggy lemongrass” symptoms indicating the plant should be moved to a sunnier location. In extremely intense sun combined with high heat and low humidity, especially in small dark pots that overheat, leaf tips may dry and brown or develop scorch patches, so in such climates a bit of afternoon shade or mulching around the base helps keep roots cool and reduces leaf burn. As a tropical grass, lemongrass prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil and does best when kept evenly damp, not allowed to completely dry out for long periods and never left sitting in waterlogged conditions; most guides recommend watering deeply whenever the top few centimeters of soil feel just slightly dry, ensuring water penetrates to the deep root zone and then allowing excess to drain away fully. In hot, sunny summer weather, especially in containers, this often translates to watering every day or every other day, because lemongrass has high transpiration and benefits from regular moisture and even some supplemental misting in very arid regions to maintain humidity around the foliage. In cooler seasons or when growth slows, watering frequency should be reduced so that the soil stays lightly moist but not saturated, typically checking with a finger and watering only when the surface begins to dry; overwatering in low light or cool temperatures can promote root rot and fungal issues, visible as yellowing leaves from the base, collapse of stems, and a sour smell from soggy soil, whereas prolonged underwatering results in drooping, rolled, or dry leaf tips and a generally wilted, thin clump that recovers slowly once deep, regular watering is resumed. Lemongrass needs a fertile, well-draining soil, ideally a moist but well-drained loam enriched with organic matter, and official horticulture and herb guides frequently mention well-drained sandy loam as particularly suitable for field cultivation, as it balances drainage with moisture retention. In pots, a high-quality, nutrient-rich potting mix with good structure is recommended, often composed of general-purpose potting soil blended with generous compost or well-rotted manure plus perlite, sand, or vermiculite to enhance drainage and aeration so that excess water moves quickly away from the roots while the mix still holds enough moisture for this water-loving grass. A pH around 6.0–7.0 is commonly cited as ideal for nutrient uptake; heavy clay soils that remain wet should be avoided or heavily amended with organic matter and coarse material, and garden soil alone is generally not advised in containers due to compaction and poor aeration. Lemongrass has a deep and spreading root system, so deep containers—often at least 30 cm (12 inches) deep, with a similar width—are recommended to give roots room, and pots must have ample drainage holes to prevent waterlogging; plastic, glazed, or terracotta pots can all work, but in very hot, dry climates plastic or glazed containers that retain moisture may reduce watering frequency, while in humid climates terracotta helps excess moisture evaporate and keeps roots healthier. As a tropical species, lemongrass grows best in warm, humid environments, with many sources noting an optimal temperature range around 21–32 °C (70–90 °F) and warning that prolonged exposure below about 10 °C (50 °F) can severely damage or kill the plant, especially if soil is wet. It is frost-sensitive and usually treated as an annual in cold climates unless grown in pots that can be brought indoors or into a greenhouse before freezing temperatures; indoors it should be placed in the brightest possible spot and kept above roughly 13 °C (55 °F) for ongoing growth, though growth slows in cooler, lower-light conditions. High humidity is beneficial, as lemongrass originates from regions with high rainfall and steamy conditions, and while it can adapt to moderate humidity, very dry air may cause leaf-tip browning, so in arid zones or heated indoor spaces, occasional misting, grouping plants, or using a humidity tray can improve vigor, provided leaves are not constantly wet, which could encourage disease. Propagation of lemongrass is most commonly done by division or planting stalks with intact basal nodes: mature clumps can be dug up and separated into smaller sections, each with several shoots and roots, which are then replanted in fertile, moist, well-draining soil; supermarket or market-bought stalks that still have their bulbous bases and a hint of root can be rooted by placing them in water or directly in moist potting mix until new roots and shoots appear. Seeds can also be used, sown indoors several weeks before the last frost in warm, moist seed mix and then transplanted outside once temperatures are reliably warm, though vegetative propagation by division is faster and ensures the same chemotype and vigor. Regarding toxicity and safety, lemongrass leaves and stalks are widely used in human cuisine and herbal teas and are generally considered non-toxic and safe for healthy adults when consumed in typical culinary amounts, though concentrated medicinal use or essential oil ingestion can cause gastrointestinal upset or interact with certain medications, so medical consultation is advisable before high-dose use, especially for pregnant people or those with chronic conditions. For pets, however, recognized authorities classify lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) as toxic to cats, dogs, and horses due to its essential oils and cyanogenic glycosides, noting that ingestion can cause stomach upset, vomiting, and diarrhea in dogs and cats, and in horses may rarely lead to respiratory difficulty, weakness, or more serious outcomes. Lemongrass essential oil is particularly dangerous to cats because they lack liver enzymes to metabolize many essential oil components, and exposure via ingestion, skin contact, or inhalation can lead to drooling, vomiting, tremors, difficulty breathing, and potentially liver damage or seizures in severe cases, prompting strong recommendations to keep concentrated lemongrass oils and heavily scented products away from pets and to seek immediate veterinary care if exposure occurs. While occasional small bites of the plant by pets may only cause mild digestive upset in many cases, the safest practice is to treat lemongrass as an ornamental-edible that should be grown out of reach of pets and children, with all essential oil preparations stored securely and used cautiously in households with animals
